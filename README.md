**ERC20 and Vault Contracts**

**Overview:**

This repository contains smart contracts written in Solidity for implementing ERC20 tokens and a Vault for securely storing these tokens.

**ERC20 Contract:**

The ERC20 contract provided in this repository adheres to the ERC20 token standard, which is widely used for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract enables functionalities such as transferring tokens between addresses, approving spending of tokens by third-party contracts, and checking token balances.

**Vault Contract:**

The Vault contract is designed to securely store ERC20 tokens. It provides functionalities for depositing tokens into the vault and withdrawing them when needed. The Vault contract implements security measures to ensure that only authorized users can access the stored tokens.
